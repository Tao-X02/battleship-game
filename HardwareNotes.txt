Some notes for the hardware side:
(note: these are mostly just for my own use -Jaswin)

Buttons (from top to bottom) correspond to the pins:
7 - X
5  - R
3  - S
2  - D

When pressed, digital read will be LOW (circuit is grounded)

bshipArduino.ino as well as any files it imports code from must be in a folder
called "bshipArduino" for it to work properly

A lot of the code in bshipArduino.ino is the same as the code in battleship.c
The only difference is that unnecessary code, such as print statements, as well
as unnecessary libraries, like stdio, have been removed to reduce memory usage.
Most strings within bshipArduino.ino are within the F() wrapper, which allows them
to be saved to the program memory rather than wasting RAM.
